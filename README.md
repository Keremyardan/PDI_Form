Pre-Delivery Inspection (PDI) Form Management System



This project is a fully digital Pre-Delivery Inspection (PDI) Form Management System, designed to replace paper-based inspection workflows with an efficient, accurate, and interactive solution. It ensures that every pre-delivery vehicle inspection step is recorded, traceable, and accessible at any time.



The system is built with a Spring Boot backend and a React / React Native frontend, providing both web-based and mobile access for field officers and administrators. The mobile version is also being developed with a responsive design.



Core functionalities include:



Role-based access control:

Administrators can view, edit, and manage all forms in the system. Officers can only access and manage the forms they have created. This ensures secure and controlled data access.



Interactive SVG-based vehicle diagram:

A custom, scalable SVG diagram of the vehicle allows users to visually select and highlight specific parts. Damage areas can be marked directly on the diagram, providing precise and visual damage reporting instead of relying solely on text descriptions.



Form structure and data capture:

Each form contains essential vehicle details such as VIN, model, and inspection date, along with functional checks, damage notes, fuel type, fuel level, and more.



Real-time submission and updates:

All form data is sent instantly to the backend via secure API calls. Any updates to existing forms are immediately reflected in the system, keeping administrators and officers synchronized.



Data integrity and security:

Built-in form validation ensures complete and consistent records. The backend manages data storage with PostgreSQL and applies role-based security measures.



Cross-platform accessibility:

The mobile version is also being developed with a responsive design.



By combining interactive SVG technology for precise visual marking, role-based permissions for secure operations, and real-time synchronization between devices, this project modernizes and streamlines the entire pre-delivery inspection process.
